<h2>PhD program</h2>
<p>If you would like to join our <a href="https://www.unibocconi.it/en/programs/phd/phd-statistics-and-computer-science">PhD program</a>, apply <a href="https://www.unibocconi.it/en/programs/phd/admissions">here</a>. The admissions open once a year, in fall, and the deadline is usually in January.</p>
<p>The official call for applications for 2025-2026 is online <a href="https://www.unibocconi.it/sites/default/files/media/attachments/Bando_STAT_CS_41_ciclo%20DR_94%202%20Ottobre%202024.pdf?VersionId=bkmMHz2fhii6XAVig7gF14Ztv6A9ewHp">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Postdoctoral research fellow</h2>
<p>I am looking for a postdoctoral research fellow to join my team and contribute to research in online learning and algorithmic game theory as part of my ERC-funded project PLA-STEER. The position offers a flexible start date in 2025 and is a fully funded, full-time research role with no mandatory teaching or coursework responsibilities.</p>
<p>The initial contract is for one year, with the possibility of a one-year extension. We provide a competitive salary, and international applicants may benefit from a special taxation scheme for researchers in Italy. This position is funded through my ERC Starting Grant, and will be based in the CS Department at Bocconi University.</p>
<p>The research project considers topics at the intersection of online learning and computational game theory. Ideal candidates should have a track record in performing top-quality research in machine learning theory/computational game theory compatible with the standards of venues like EC, ICML, NeurIPS. Demonstrated past experience with such topics will be evaluated very positively.</p>
<p><b>About the environment</b>: Bocconi University is a renowned private institution located in Milan, Italy. The newly established Computing Sciences department can already count on a sizeable theory group comprising researchers like Alon Rosen, Laura Sanità, Marek Elias, Adam Polak, Emmanuela Orsini, Tommaso D’Orsi and Giulio Malavolta. The department hosts a diverse array of researchers actively involved in both the theoretical and practical aspects of Machine Learning. Some colleagues in this domain include Dirk Hovy, Riccardo Zecchina, Marc Mézard, and several others.</p>
<p>The official call for applications is not yet open. I will update this post with a link to Bocconi’s job market page as soon as it becomes available. In the meantime, feel free to contact me via email if you are interested in the position or would like additional information</p>
