<h2>Postdoctoral research fellow</h2>
<p>I am looking for a postdoctoral research fellow to join my team and contribute to research in online learning and computational game theory. The starting date is flexible, as long as it falls within the period of April to September 2024. This is a fully funded, full-time research opportunity that does not involve any mandatory teaching duties or coursework. The contract duration for this position is expected to be 12 months. We offer a very competitive salary, and applicants from outside Italy may have the opportunity to benefit from a researcher taxation scheme.</p>
<p>This position is made possible through a collaborative research grant shared between Bocconi University and Politecnico di Milano. The successful candidate will be based at the <a href="https://cs.unibocconi.eu/">CS department</a> of Bocconi University in Milan and will work under my supervision. Additionally, they will have the opportunity to closely collaborate with <a href="https://albymarke.github.io/">Alberto Marchesi</a>'s group at Politecnico di Milano. Moreover, there is a possibility of engaging in collaborative projects with other researchers from both institutions.</p>
<p>The research project considers topics at the intersection of online learning and computational game theory. </p>
<p>Ideal candidates should have a track record in performing top-quality research in machine learning theory/computational game theory compatible with the standards of venues like EC, ICML, NeurIPS. Demonstrated past experience with such topics will be evaluated very positively.</p>
<p><b>About the environment</b>: Bocconi University is a renowned private institution located in Milan, Italy. The newly established <a href="https://cs.unibocconi.eu/">Computing Sciences</a> department can already count on a sizeable theory group comprising researchers like <a href="https://lucatrevisan.github.io/">Luca Trevisan</a>, <a href="https://www.alonrosen.net/">Alon Rosen</a>, <a href="https://laurasanita.github.io/">Laura Sanità</a>, <a href="http://elias.ba30.eu/">Marek Elias</a>, <a href="https://cseao.github.io/">Emmanuela Orsini</a>, <a href="https://adampolak.github.io/">Adam Polak</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/giuliomalavolta/">Giulio Malavolta</a>. Moreover, there's a diverse array of researchers actively involved in both the theoretical and practical aspects of Machine Learning, such as <a href="https://milanlproc.github.io/">Dirk Hovy</a>, Riccardo Zecchina, Marc Mézard, and many others.</p>
<p><font color=red size=+0.5><b>The official call for applications has not been launched yet. However, I will make sure to keep this post updated with a direct link to Bocconi University's job market page as soon as it becomes available. In the meantime, if you are interested in this postdoctoral position and seek further information, please do not hesitate to reach out to me at andrea.celli2@unibocconi.it. Please attach an up-to-date CV including a list of publications. </p>
